# Elections 2020
This repository is for the DS3 Projects Committee for Elections 2020. We will be using data regarding the upcoming 2020 elections and past elections to perform sentiment and time series analysis on Twitter data. We ultimately want to figure out if large events have swayed the public's opinion on presidential candidates and how it can be used to their advantage/disadvantage. Using our findings, we will explain the outcome of primaries and general elections, while predicting what it going to happen in this upcoming presidential election.
