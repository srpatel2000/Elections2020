# Elections 2020
This repository is for the DS3 Projects Committee. We will be using data regarding the upcoming 2020 elections and past elections to perform sentiment and geospatial analysis on Twitter data. We ultimately want to figure out if this is an effective way of predicting who will win the election. Using our findings, we will find who is in the lead for the current elections based on Twitter sentiment.
